You are a senior enterprise architect.

From the currently opened Architecture Vision (AV) document, extract a structured Application Card.

Important rules:
- Use only information explicitly present in the document.
- Do not invent capabilities, integrations, or technologies.
- If information is missing, mark it as "Not Specified".
- If the system is a monolith and only context-level C4 is available, infer capabilities only if clearly described in text.
- Keep output structured and concise.
- Do NOT include NFRs (ignore SLA, performance, scaling).

If C4 diagrams are present:
- Identify upstream systems from arrows pointing toward this system.
- Identify downstream systems from arrows originating from this system.
- Capture integration types if labeled.
- Do not infer missing integration types unless explicitly stated.

Describe the C4 diagram in text first, then extract the Application Card.

Produce the output in the following JSON format:

{
  "application_name": "",
  "domain": "",
  "application_type": "Monolith | Microservice | External | SaaS | Not Specified",
  "description": "",
  "exposed_interfaces": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "integration_type": "REST | SOAP | MQ | File | SWIFT | DB | Not Specified",
      "sync_or_async": "Sync | Async | Batch | Not Specified",
      "called_by": []
    }
  ],
  "outbound_calls": [
    {
      "target_application": "",
      "integration_type": "",
      "sync_or_async": ""
    }
  ],
  "published_events": [],
  "consumed_events": [],
  "data_stores_used": [],
  "business_capabilities_provided": [],
  "key_dependencies": [],
  "notes_or_constraints_from_document": []
}

After JSON, provide a short human-readable summary (max 8 lines).
