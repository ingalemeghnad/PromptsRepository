You are a senior enterprise architect.

From the currently opened Interface Catalog document, extract a structured Application Card for the application described.

Important rules:
- Use only information explicitly present in the document.
- Do NOT invent capabilities, integrations, or technologies.
- If information is missing, mark it as "Not Specified".
- Do NOT infer NFRs (ignore SLA, latency, scaling).
- If the application appears to be a monolith, classify it as "Monolith" only if clearly indicated.
- Consolidate duplicate interfaces if repeated.

Produce the output in the following JSON format:

{
  "application_name": "",
  "domain": "",
  "application_type": "Monolith | Microservice | External | SaaS | Not Specified",
  "description": "",

  "interfaces": [
    {
      "interface_id": "",
      "interface_name": "",
      "direction": "Inbound | Outbound | Not Specified",
      "integration_type": "REST | SOAP | MQ | Kafka | File | SWIFT | DB | Not Specified",
      "sync_or_async": "Sync | Async | Batch | Not Specified",
      "counterparty_application": [],
      "business_purpose": "",
      "event_or_api_name": "",
      "version": "Not Specified"
    }
  ],

  "published_events": [],
  "consumed_events": [],

  "inferred_business_capabilities": [],

  "data_stores_if_mentioned": [],

  "notes_from_catalog": []
}

After JSON, provide:
1. A short structural summary (max 8 lines)
2. A list of any ambiguities or missing details in the catalog
