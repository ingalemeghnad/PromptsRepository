From the following E2E design:

1. Identify the primary execution path in correct time order.
2. Define this as the horizontal spine.
3. Identify secondary systems (event consumers, monitoring, batch).
4. Place secondary systems vertically aligned under the relevant primary node.
5. Ensure no backward arrows in primary flow.
6. Keep diagram visually linear and readable.
